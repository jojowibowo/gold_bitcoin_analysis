## **Project Summary**  
Developed a regime-aware, AI-assisted decision-support framework to help Singaporean retail investors navigate the "Retail Dilemma." Traditional inflation hedges often fail during macro-financial stress; this project provides a data-driven alternative to static investment claims.

### **The Problem**  
Singaporean investors face fragmented information and conflicting narratives. Static tools fail to capture **regime shifts**, leading to misaligned risk assessments for assets like Gold and Bitcoin during periods of high inflation.

### **The Solution:** "Traffic Light" Indicators  
-   **Gold (The Stabilizer):** Identified as a Macro-Stress Stabilizer (0.017 correlation to CPI). It functions as a defensive hedge against currency shocks rather than a direct inflation tracker.
    
-   **Bitcoin (The Sentiment Asset):** Characterized as a Sentiment-Driven Risk Asset. 50.5% of its top-feature importance is derived from market mood (Fear & Greed Index).

---

## **Key Analytical Insights**  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> **Core Strategy:** Use Gold defensively for macro stability and Bitcoin tactically for sentiment-based growth.

| **Asset** | **Key Driver** | **2026 Strategy** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gold** | Macro Stress / USD-SGD Vol | Buy during High Macro Stress (>60) |
| **Bitcoin** | Market Sentiment | Tactical exposure during Greed (>50) |

### **Model Performance Proof**  

-   **Predictive Edge:** The Logistic Regression model achieved **60.6% accuracy** in predicting Bitcoin's directional movement.
    
-   **Feature Dominance:** In the Random Forest model, the **Crypto Fear & Greed Index** was the single most influential variable (Importance: **0.3204**), far outweighing traditional macro indicators.

## **Technical Implementation (Scope & Responsibility)**  
### **Data Pipeline & Methods**  
As the **Analyst**, I managed the end-to-end data pipeline involving 410 weekly observations:

-   **Data Engineering:** Integrated disparate sources (Yahoo Finance, FRED, SingStat) and applied **Winsorization** to mitigate the impact of extreme market outliers.
    
-   **Feature Engineering:** Developed normalized 0–100 stress indices and percentile-based scaling to simplify complex signals for retail users.
    
-   **Modeling:** Benchmarked Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression to determine the most interpretable regime signals.
    
### **Tools & Stack**  
`Python` `Pandas` `Scikit-Learn` `Tableau` `Yahoo Finance API`
